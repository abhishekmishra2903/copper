This is a data set from a copper factory. We are trying to make a model to predict the selling price and the likelihood of customer's conversion. Several regression models and classification models were tried to achieve the two objectives, all of which can be seen in the .pynb file attached. An R^2 value of 0.85 was achieved for the regression and accuracy score of 92 percent was achieved for the classifier.

The .pynb shows the experimentation, EDA, cleaning etc while the .py file makes the streamlit page to take inputs of independent variables and display the predictions. 'Picle' was used to copy the ML model from jupyter notebook to streamlit. The pickle files has not been uploaded here due to size constraints but the .pynb file consists of a code-block to save the concerned pickle file in the local directory.
